I want to brainstorm or refine a spec for the current dev session.

Check in `docs/dev-sessions` for a current dev session directory that we have already started. Read the `spec.md` file found there for initial context.

Ask me one question at a time so we can develop a thorough, step-by-step spec for this idea. Each question should build on my previous answers, and our end goal is to have a detailed specification I can hand off to a developer. Letâ€™s do this iteratively and dig into every relevant detail. Remember, only one question at a time.

Once we are done, save the spec as spec.md, making sure to preserve any existing text that we started with along with adding the results of brainstorming and refinement.
