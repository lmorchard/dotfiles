If not already created, create `notes.md` in the current dev session directory. 

Read @../docs/dev-sessions.md for information on how to structure a development session.

Think carefully about our session so far and add notes on a complete summary of our session. Include:

- A brief recap of key actions.
- Highlight anything we did that diverged from the original plan.
- Extract any key insights or lessons learned.
- Total cost of the session.
- Efficiency insights.
- Possible process improvements.
- The total number of conversation turns.
- Any other interesting observations or highlights.
