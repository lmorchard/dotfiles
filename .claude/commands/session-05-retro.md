I want to end the current dev session and perform a retrospective on it.

Think carefully about our session so far and write notes on a complete summary of our session.

If not already created, create `notes.md` in the current dev session directory. This will be in the same directory as spec.md

In your notes, include at least the following:

- A brief recap of key actions.
- Highlight anything we did that diverged from the original plan.
- Extract any key insights or lessons learned.
- Total cost of the session.
- Efficiency insights.
- Possible process improvements.
- The total number of conversation turns.
- Any other interesting observations or highlights.

Ask me any questions about the session that you think might be worth recording in the notes.
