Please review ALL uncommitted changes in this git repository.

Be sure you are in the root directory of the current project. DO NOT OPERATE FROM A SUBDIRECTORY.

Use `git status` and `git diff` to be sure you've found ALL uncommitted changes.

Stage ALL changes (tracked and untracked), compose a detailed commit message, and commit everything that's not already committed.
Compose a detailed message and commit. Then run git status to verify no uncommitted changes remain.

IF YOU HAVE MISSED ANY UNCOMMITTED OR UNSTAGED FILES, REVIEW THEM, ADD THEM, AND AMEND THE COMMIT DESCRIPTION TO INCLUDE THEM.

DO NOT BE SELECTIVE WITH RESPECT TO RECENT ACTIVITY - INCLUDE *ALL* UNCOMMITTED CHANGES.

DO NOT PUSH THE CHANGES - ONLY COMMIT LOCALLY. I will review and possibly make further revisions and amendments.
