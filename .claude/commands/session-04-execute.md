I want to execute the plan for the current dev session.

We should have plan.md, spec.md, and notes.md for the current dev session. Confirm that we have these files.

Read the plan.md and spec.md files and decide whether the plan is detailed and ready for implementation. If not, ask me to provide more details.

If the plan is detailed and ready for implementation, execute the plan.

While executing the plan, be sure to update the notes.md file as you go to reflect the progress of the plan.

After each phase or major batch of changes, please commit to git with a message summarizing the phase. Do not push to remote, yet. I will review changes in git when the plan is done.
